# Meteor Survivors Game (demo)

Instructions: Use A and D to rotate the ship left and right. Press W to propel the ship forward. Press or hold Spacebar to fire lasers from the ship. Getting hit by a meteor removes one life from your ship.

Goal: Survive for as long as possible. Collect experience dropped from meteors you shoot and destroy to gain upgrades such as increased life points, fire rate, or ship speed. There are hard caps on life points (5) and fire rate (10 shots/sec).

Make sure to run the main (main.tscn) scene to play the game.

Hud includes life count (top left), survival timer (top middle), and experience level (top right).
